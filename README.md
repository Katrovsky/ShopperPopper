# Shopper Archive

This repository serves as an archive for APK releases of the Shopper application. It automatically fetches and stores new versions of the app as they become available.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this archive is to:

1. Maintain a historical record of all Shopper app versions.
2. Provide easy access to previous versions of the app.
3. Automatically update with new releases.
